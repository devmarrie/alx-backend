## Caching
The purpose of a caching system is to improve the performance and efficiency of an application by reducing the time it takes to retrieve frequently accessed data.

When an application needs to access data repeatedly, fetching it from the original source each time can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. However, if the data is cached in memory, subsequent accesses can be satisfied more quickly because the data is readily available.

A caching system can be used to store the results of computations, database queries, or any other type of data that is expensive to generate or retrieve. By storing this data in memory, a caching system can reduce the overall response time of an application, improve scalability, and reduce the load on the underlying resources.

In summary, the purpose of a caching system is to improve the performance and scalability of an application by reducing the time it takes to retrieve frequently accessed data, thereby improving the user experience and reducing the load on the underlying resources.
